# Postmortem
This postmortem is about an experience that happened to me.

## Issue Summary

I employed someone who had more knowledge to help me fix it

## Cause and Solution

The website was already gaining traffic and there was not enough space on the server

I had to employ someone to fix it but i later had to take the website down cause i couldn't maintain it
